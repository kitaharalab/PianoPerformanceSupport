# AutoDrum

AutoDrum is a drum performance system that automatically matches the intensity of the sound to the performance.
For musicians who want to play with a drummer, we will present a study of automatic drum playing systems.

Automatic drum performance has been studied so far, but the automatic drum performance system, which is a research product, outputs the selected drum pattern, but does not add expression[^1] to the performance.

[^1]:change the intensity, tempo, and timing of the sound

This research is to make it possible to output drum performances with expressions of sound intensity (velocity) in order to make the drum performance output by the system more expressive.
